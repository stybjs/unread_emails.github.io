            I hope this message finds you well. I am concerned about the last several sessions you missed and I would
            like to remind you that you need to attend your sessions at this month.<br><br>

            If you keep doing this, you are damaging your mental health progress and I understand you have issues with your romantic relationship.
            Please make an appointment to see me as soon as possible so we can discuss your situation and find ways to help you cope.<br><br>
            
            Looking forward to hearing from you.<br><br>
            
            Best regards,<br>

            Hi, <br><br>
            I noticed a small discrepancy in last week’s badge access logs and wanted to double-check. <br><br> 
            Your ID pinged near the West Maintenance Wing at 20:45 on Thursday. <br><br> 
            Probably just a scanner glitch — those readers misfire all the time. <br>br>
            When you get a moment, can you confirm whether you were anywhere near that hallway? <br><br> No rush.

            Thanks! <br><br>

    Let me know how you're doing. I'm really worried about you. You can always ask for my referral to obtain medication. 
    Please remember that your discussion is significant.

    Please let me know how you're doing and I am really worrying about you. 
    You have not responded to emails, even my calls. You can always contact my office,

    Please at least let me know you sound safe, okay?

      It’s crazy that somebody in our team was accused of leaking confidential information, even when they are innocent.

      Anyways, do you remember the senior guy we saw? They will join our team night dinner, if you are interested. Let me know! 

      I know you have marriage issues. You shouldn’t bring your personal issues into our workplace.  
      Why don’t you divorce them? I mean they are pretty bad. They should be understandable about your work.
